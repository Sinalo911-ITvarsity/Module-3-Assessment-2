                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Mushroom soup with pickled mushrooms is a hearty and flavorful dish made with a creamy mushroom base and topped with tangy pickled mushrooms. The soup is typically prepared by saut√©ing mushrooms, onions, and garlic until they are soft and fragrant, then simmering them in broth until they are tender. Cream or milk is often added to create a rich and creamy texture. The pickled mushrooms, with their acidic and slightly sweet flavor, add a contrasting brightness to the dish, enhancing its overall complexity. This soup is a comforting and satisfying option, perfect for a cozy meal during cooler weather.</p>
