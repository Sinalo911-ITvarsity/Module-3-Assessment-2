                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>"Mast Biryani" is a flavorful and aromatic dish that originated in South Asia, known for its fragrant rice and tender meat or vegetables. The dish typically involves cooking long-grain basmati rice with a blend of spices, such as cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, and layering it with marinated meat or vegetables. It's then slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together, resulting in a rich and satisfying meal. Biryani is often served with accompaniments like raita (yogurt sauce), salad, or pickles, adding to its complexity and depth of flavor.</p>
